The caster determines at what range he will cast the spell.

Sphere: Plant
Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Breath partial

By means of this spell, the caster causes plants to entangle all creatures in the area of effect. The grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about the creatures, holding them fast for the duration of the spell. Those held receive a -2 penalty to attack rolls and a +2 penalty to AC. Creatures that make a successful saving throw vs. breath temporarily avoid entanglement and can move at half speed through the area, but must make additional saving throws each round they remain in the area of effect. An entangled creature can attack, provided it does not have to move to reach an opponent. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are elementals and exceptionally large and strong creatures who suffer little to no distress from the entangling plants.~

Sphere: Charm, Protection
Range: Personal
Duration: 6 rounds

When the priest casts a Sanctuary spell, it causes all of his opponents to ignore his existence, as if he were invisible. While protected by this spell, the subject cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use non-attack spells focused on himself or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded priest to heal his wounds, for example, or to cast a Chant spell. He cannot cast spells on other targets without ending the spell.~

Level: 1
School: Alteration

Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to create a magical cudgel. The shillelagh inflicts 2d4+1 points of damage on a successful hit and causes tendrils to wrap around and hold the victim in place for one round unless a save vs. breath is made. The caster wields the shillelagh as if proficient with the weapon, at his normal THAC0. At level 1, it functions as a magical weapon with an enchantment bonus of +1. For every other four experience levels of the spellcaster, this bonus increases by one, up to a total of +3 enchantment level, +3 to attack rolls, and +3 to damage for a 9th-level caster. The shillelagh can be used only by the caster, and remains in his hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 5' radius
Saving Throw: Spell negates

When this spell is cast, a pale glow surrounds and outlines all enemies within the area of effect, making their position and movements easily visible. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness, invisibility, or similar effects, and suffer a -2 penalty to AC. Those who succeed at a saving throw vs. spell are totally unaffected by the spell. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.~

@28=~Strength of Stone
Level: 1
School: Alteration
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: Personal
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Calling upon the strength of the earth, the caster gains some of the solidity and strength of stone. This spell sets the strength of the character to 18 and then adds 50 exceptional strength on top of this. The character receives any strength bonuses appropriate. For example, if a character has between 18/50 and 18/00 strength, then his strength will just be set to 18/00. If a character has a strength between 18/01 and 18/50, then his strength will become 18/50 + original percentage. If his strength is less then 18, then it will just become 18/50. However, this spell will actually lower a character's strength if it is already 19 or more. For the duration of the spell, the caster also becomes immune to everything, magical or otherwise, that pushes him away (e.g. wing buffets, gusts of wind, telekinesis, etc.), but will move at a reduced speed.~

Undead creatures and monsters vulnerable to bright light suffer double damage (up to a maximum of 12d6). If the target successfully rolls a saving throw vs. breath he will receive only half damage.

Multiple Chant spells are not cumulative.~

Level: 2
School: Enchantment
Sphere: Animal
Range: Medium
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 person or animal
Saving Throw: Spell negates

This spell affects any single person or animal it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, kobolds, and others. Only normal and giant sized animals are affected by this spell. Monsters such as wyverns, ankhegs, and carrion crawlers do not count as animals.

The target receives a saving throw vs. spell at to avoid the effect. If the recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed creature will carry them out as quickly as possible. If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed creature by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creature, the charm spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence.~

Range: Personal
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: None

When a priest casts a find traps spell, all traps - concealed normally or magically - of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to him. Once per round, all traps within a 30 foot radius of the caster will be revealed. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the creator specifically intended the harmful or undesirable result as such. Thus, traps include glyphs and similar spells or devices.~

@41=~Flame Blade~
@42=~Flame Blade
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: Personal
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from his hand. The caster wields this blade-like ray as if proficient with the weapon, at his normal THAC0. At level 3, it functions as a magical weapon, dealing 2d6+1 points of fire damage, with an enchantment bonus of +1. For every other three experience levels of the spellcaster, this bonus increases by one, up to a total of +3 enchantment level, +3 to attack rolls, and +3 to damage for a 9th-level caster. Since the blade is immaterial, strength modifiers do not apply to attack rolls or damage, and attacks with the flame blade are considered melee touch attacks (+4 attack roll bonus).~

@44=~Goodberry
Level: 1
School: Alteration
Sphere: Plant
Range: Personal
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Casting a Goodberry spell creates 5 magical berries that the caster can carry with him or give to others. These berries initially cure 1 point of physical damage for each one eaten. For every three levels of experience, the berries heal one additional point of damage (to a maximum of 7 points at level 18). The berries last for 8 hours, or until eaten.~

Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 5'
Saving Throw: Spell negates

This spell holds one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for one turn. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also affected. Those who succeed at a saving throw vs. spell are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held with this spell.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

Certain magical devices negate the power of the Know Opponent spell, and the spell has no effect on creatures who don't emanate auras, such as constructs. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.~

Level: 2
School: Alteration
Sphere: Guardian
Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 15' radius
Saving Throw: Spell negates

Upon casting this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: conversation is impossible and spells cannot be cast unless an affected spellcaster then casts Vocalize. All enemies in the area must make a saving throw vs. spell at -4; if the save is failed, then they are silenced for the duration of the spell. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 15 foot radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).~

By calling upon his deity, the caster of a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a field of force shaped vaguely like a hammer. The caster wields the spiritual hammer as if proficient with the weapon, at his normal THAC0. As long as the caster concentrates upon the hammer, it can be used to strike at any opponents within 20 feet, but the wielder does not receive the standard penalty for holding a ranged weapon when engaged in close combat. At level 1, it functions as a magical weapon, dealing 1d8+1 points of magic damage, with an enchantment bonus of +1. For every five experience levels of the spellcaster, this bonus increases by one, up to a total of +5 enchantment level, +5 to attack rolls, and +5 to damage for a 20th-level caster. Due to its ethereal nature, strength modifiers do not apply to attack rolls or damage, and attacks with the spiritual weapon are considered melee touch attacks (+4 attack roll bonus).~

This powerful trap harms those who enter, pass, or open the selected area or object. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. Any enemy violating the selected area will trigger the trap.

When the spell is cast, the druid weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When a hostile creature comes within 15 feet of the trap, it is triggered and explodes, damaging every enemy within a 20 foot radius. The damage inflicted is equal to 1d4 points of fire damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d4). Those who a roll successful saving throw vs. breath will receive only half damage.

Range: Long
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 360' radius
Saving Throw: Breath half

Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, the caster causes a 30-foot-long vertical bolt of lightning to come crashing down upon an enemy. The spell has a duration of one round for every three levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 5 rounds at 15th level. The lightning will strike first at the target of the spell, dealing 6d6 points of electrical damage, with a successful save vs. breath at -2 reducing this to half. For the remainder of the storm's duration, the bolts will strike out randomly at the enemies of the caster.~

@75=~Dispel Magic~
@76=~Dispel Magic
Level: 3
School: Abjuration
Sphere: All
Range: Long
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 20' radius
Saving Throw: Special

Dispel Magic removes magical effects upon any enemies within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is above the level of the magic he is trying to dispel, his chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the level of the magic he attempts to dispel, his chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.~

When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When a hostile creature comes within 15 feet of the glyph, it is triggered and explodes, damaging every enemy within a 20 foot radius. The damage inflicted is equal to 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d4). Those who a roll successful saving throw vs. breath will receive only half damage.

Those who succeed on a save vs. spell at -2 are totally unaffected.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

Saving Throw: None

When a druid casts this powerful spell upon herself, an outer skin of stone will emerge from the ground, completely covering and shielding her. This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the druid in no way. The effect of this is to protect the druid from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. One skin is gained for every two levels of the caster. For each skin the druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th level druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against her but the sixth would affect her normally. The skins will remain on the druid until she is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires.

It is important to note that this will not protect the druid from any area attacks (such as Fireball), and that any weapon capable of inflicting some type of elemental damage can still harm the caster - the skins will not protect against fire, cold, acid, or electrical damage, even if physical damage is blocked.

Polymorph Other is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. The target's mental attributes are not affected and they do not receive the special abilities of the new form, but physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form and the affected creature loses any special abilities it had in its original form. This particular version of the spell will transform the recipient into a squirrel unless a save vs. polymorph is made successfully. The effectiveness of this spell is dependent upon the target's level, with weak creatures being relatively easy to transmute and more powerful creatures being very difficult. Creatures with less than 8 HD/levels save at a -4 penalty, those with 8 - 14 HD/levels save normally, and those with 15 or more HD/levels save with a +2 bonus. The transformation is instant and permanent until a dispel magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature.

Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast by a druid, a local earthquake rips the ground. Once every round for the spell's duration, a tremor will take place, affecting all creatures in its area of effect. Earth elementals and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell.

There are three tremors that are caused by the earthquake. The first tremor causes all creatures affected to suffer 6d6 points of damage (save vs. paralyzation at -6 for half damage). Those who fail their saving throw fall to the ground unconscious for 2 rounds. The second tremor is less severe, causing 4d6 points of damage (save vs. death at -4 for half), but is accompanied by fissures opening in the earth, which all affected creatures have a 20% chance to fall into and die (save vs. breath at -4 negates). The final tremor causes 2d6 damage (save vs. death at -2 for half) and there is a 10% chance affected creatures will be trapped within the fissures, causing death (save vs. breath at -2 negates). Creatures knocked unconscious by the first tremor automatically fail any saves to try to avoid falling into or becoming trapped in the fissures.

This spell will affect both enemies and friends of the caster, so care must be taken in its use. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.~

Level: 3
School: Alteration
Sphere: Plant
Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 20' radius
Saving Throw: Breath partial

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. Any creature will suffer 1d4 points of piercing damage each round that they remain within the affected area. The spikes can damage the victim's legs, so that even once they are free of the spike growth their movement rate is halved for 3 rounds unless a successful save vs. breath is made. Those failing the save also suffer 1 point of bleeding damage each round for 3 rounds. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are elementals and exceptionally large creatures who suffer little to no distress from the small spikes.~
