@402=~Grease
Level: 1
School: Conjuration
Range: Medium
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: Breath partial

A Grease spell covers a material surface with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy nature. Any creature caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. breath at +2 bonus or fall to the ground for one round. Those who enter the area or remain within it must make a save each round until they reach the nearest non-greased surface. A creature that succeeds on their saving throw can walk within or through the area of grease but will have their movements slowed considerably. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are exceptionally large creatures who suffer little to no distress from the greasy coating.~

@404=~Mage Armor
Level: 1
School: Conjuration
Range: Personal
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that sets its base armor class to 6. This improves by 1 AC for every four levels of the caster, up to a minimum base armor class of 3 at 12th level. This armor does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration runs out.~

@405=~Burning Hands~
@406=~Burning Hands
Level: 1
School: Evocation
Range: Special
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When the wizard casts this spell, a cone of searing flames shoots from his fingertips towards a designated point. His hands must be held so as to send forth a fan-like sheet of flames: the wizard's thumbs must touch each other and his fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out 10-foot-long jets of flame in a horizontal arc of about 60 degrees in front of the wizard. All creatures caught in the flames suffer 1d6 points of fire damage plus 1d6 for every other 2 levels of the caster (up to a maximum of 5d6).~

@407=~Charm Person~
@408=~Charm Person
Level: 1
School: Enchantment
Range: Long
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Spell negates

This spell affects any single person that it is cast upon. The term "person" includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, kobolds, and others. If the target fails their save vs. spell, they regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected for the duration of the spell. The caster may give them orders, and the charmed creature will carry them out as quickly as possible.

Creatures that are currently neutral to the caster are more amenable to helping them and make their saving throw with no bonus, while those that are hostile are significantly more difficult to influence and instead gain a +4 bonus to making their saving throw. If the caster attempts to harm the charmed creature, the spell is broken and the affected creature will immediately become hostile to the caster. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. After the duration of the spell or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the affected creature resumes their previous behavior prior to being charmed.~

School: Alteration
Range: Special
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Spell negates

Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes a vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors to spring forth from his hand. The spray is 15 feet in length and spread out in a horizontal arc of about 60 degrees in front of the wizard. The spell's effects depend upon the caster's level - creatures with Hit Dice/levels less than or equal to the caster are slowed for 5 rounds, those with Hit Dice/levels one or two greater than the wizard are blinded for 3 rounds, and all others are confused for 1 round. Creatures with more than 22 Hit Dice/levels will have to save only against the confusion effect, regardless of the caster's level.~

Range: Long
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 20' radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, a misty bank of fog billows out from the designated point obscuring all sight. Everyone within the cloud suffer -2 penalty to attack rolls, and have their line of sight halved. Anyone, inside or outside the cloud, trying to attack a creature concealed by the fog with ranged weapons will do so with a -4 penalty to attack rolls.

By means of this spell, the caster summons a number of monsters, which serve the mage under any conditions.

Level: 1
School: Alteration
Range: Personal
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When cast, this spell provides all friendly creatures in the area with an amazing fleetness of foot. The affected creatures movement rate is almost tripled for the duration of the spell, but the excessively unnatural speed prevents them from taking almost any other actions except for running.~

@418=~Identify
Level: 1
School: Divination
Range: Personal
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: 1 item

Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1

Level: 1
School: Evocation
Range: Long
Duration: Instant

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Use of the Magic Missile spell, one of the most popular first level spells, creates up to five missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. For every two extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile - he has two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, and a maximum of five missiles at 9th level.~

School: Abjuration
Range: Touch
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: first, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a -2 penalty to their attack roll, and second, any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.~

@425=~Shield~
@426=~Shield
Level: 1
School: Abjuration
Range: Personal
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, an invisible barrier comes into being in front of the wizard, granting him immunity to the spell Magic Missile. Furthermore, the fluctuating force shield around the caster acts similarly to a regular shield, effectively increasing AC by 2 points (+4 vs. missile weapons). This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

@428=~Shocking Grasp
Level: 1
School: Evocation
Range: Personal
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

When the wizard touches a creature while this spell is in effect, an electrical charge will deal 1d6 points of damage and stun the target for 1 round. If the target makes a successful saving throw vs. spell, he is not stunned. For every two extra experience levels of the caster, the creature will suffer an additional 1d6 points of damage and roll their saving throw at an increased -1 penalty (to a maximum of 5d6 damage and a -4 saving throw penalty at 9th level). The spell expires once the caster makes a successful melee attack or after 1 turn has passed. The wizard gains a +4 bonus to hit the target.~

@429=~Sleep~
@430=~Sleep
Level: 1
School: Enchantment
Range: Long
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Spell negates

When a wizard casts a Sleep spell, he causes a comatose slumber to come upon one or more creatures. Creatures in the area of effect must make a saving throw vs. spell or fall asleep. Any further attempts to harm the targets will waken them. Opponents with more Hit Dice/levels than the caster are unaffected by this spell. Elves and half-elves are particularly resistant to sleep effects, while the undead and certain other creatures such as dragons and elementals are completely immune to magically induced sleep.~

Level: 1
School: Necromancy
Range: Personal
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

When the caster completes this spell, a blue glow encompasses his hand. This energy attacks the life force of any living creature upon which the wizard makes a successful melee attack. The touched creature suffers 1d6 points of cold damage and loses one point of strength for 1 hour (no ability drain if the victim saves vs. death). The wizard gains a +4 bonus to hit the target and his touch is considered to be of +1 enchantment to determine what it can hit.~

@434=~Chromatic Orb
Level: 1
School: Alteration
Range: Long
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Spell partial

This spell causes a 2-foot-diameter sphere to appear in the caster's hand. When thrown, the sphere heads unerringly towards its target. The sphere inflicts magic damage and causes different effects depending upon its color. As the level of the caster improves, both the damage inflicted and number of colors known increases. The color of any given orb is chosen randomly from the colors known at the wizard's level. The orb is occasionally even multicolored, causing multiple effects. The victim can save vs. spell against all special effects but gets no save against the damage. All special effects last for 5 rounds.

1st level: 1d3 damage; White - Light (-4 penalty to saving throws)
2nd level: 1d4 damage; Aquamarine - Magnetism (-4 penalty to AC)

School: Necromancy
Range: Long
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to his own. The target creature suffers 2 points of damage, while the mage gains 2 hit points. For every two extra levels of the caster, the draining is augmented by 2 points (up to a maximum of 10 points at 9th level). If the mage goes over his maximum hit point total with this spell, he loses it after 1 turn.~

@437=~Reflected Image~
@438=~Reflected Image
Level: 1
School: Illusion
Range: Personal
Duration: 4 rounds +1 round/3 levels
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the wizard creates one illusory image of himself that will travel alongside him. The image performs all of the actions that the wizard does, and seems to react normally to both physical and magical damage (such as appearing to be burned when hit by a fireball) so that if any enemies are trying to attack the wizard they will not know which one is real. There is a 50% chance that an attacker will attack the image and a 50% chance that he will attack the caster. The image is immune to all forms of damage, but will disappear if a dispel magic or a detect illusion spell is cast upon it, or when the spell duration runs out. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is under the effects of a Mirror Image spell, and multiple castings of this spell will not create additional images.~

@439=~Find Familiar~
@440=~Find Familiar
Level: 1
School: Universal
Range: Short
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to summon a familiar to act as his aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and he has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all. Note that this spell may only be cast by the protagonist.

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The caster receives half the familiar's total hit points as bonus hit points. However, the caster must take care to treat his familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster will lose the bonus hit points and half the familiar's hit points again as damage. Also, when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of constitution permanently.

Example: A mage has 15 hit points and casts Find Familiar. The imp summoned has 24 hit points, so the caster gets a bonus of 12 hit points. The caster now has 27 hit points. If the familiar dies, the caster will lose those additional 12 hit points (putting him back at 12), permanently lose 1 point of constitution (which may cause additional hit point loss), and take 12 damage.

Here is a list of the familiars that the player receives according to alignment:

LAWFUL GOOD, NEUTRAL GOOD:  Pseudo Dragon
CHAOTIC GOOD:  Fairy Dragon

LAWFUL NEUTRAL:  Ferret
NEUTRAL:  Rabbit
CHAOTIC NEUTRAL:  Cat

LAWFUL EVIL:  Imp
NEUTRAL EVIL:  Dust Mephit
CHAOTIC EVIL:  Quasit

You can view your familiar's statistics from the inventory screen.~

@441=~Nahal's Reckless Dweomer~
@442=~Nahal's Reckless Dweomer
Level: 1
School: Conjuration
Range: Personal
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is the wild mage's ultimate last-resort spell. When cast, the mage releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but something almost always occurs in the process.

To use Reckless Dweomer, simply cast it and then choose from your list of known spells. A burst of magical energy is released, which the wild mage tries to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is determined randomly by a dice roll on the Wild Surge Table (found in your manual).

Because the release of energy is planned by the mage, his level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected. The result may be beneficial to the mage or it may be completely disastrous; this is the risk the mage takes in casting Nahal's Reckless Dweomer.~

@443=~Spook~
@444=~Spook
Level: 1
School: Illusion
Range: Long
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

A Spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the spellcaster as someone or something inimical which then appears to advance upon it in a threatening manner. If the creature does not make a successful saving throw vs. spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible. The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 (to save against this spell) for every two extra experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -4 at 9th level. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Undead creatures, certain powerful creatures who can easily discern the illusion, such as dragons, and those with no intelligence score are unaffected by this spell, as are creatures under the effect of a True Seeing spell.~

@445=~Protection from Petrification~
@446=~Protection from Petrification
Level: 1
School: Abjuration
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 hour

@451=~Blur~
@452=~Blur
Level: 2
School: Illusion
Range: Personal
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

A Blur spell causes the mage's form and spirit to become blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion causes all melee and missile attacks against the caster to be made with -3 penalties, whereas all saves vs. spell are made by the caster with a +3 bonus. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~

@453=~Detect Alignment~
@454=~Detect Alignment
Level: 2
School: Divination
Range: Personal
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the wizard to search out the feelings of all creatures within the current area. When affected by this spell, a target will briefly glow red if he's evil, green if he's good, and white if he's neutral. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.~

@455=~Detect Invisibility~
@456=~Detect Invisibility
Level: 2
School: Divination
Range: Personal
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 50' radius
Saving Throw: None

When a wizard casts a Detect Invisibility spell, he becomes able to see clearly any objects or beings that are invisible within a 50 foot radius, as well as any that are astral, ethereal, or out of phase. Instantly and once each round for 5 rounds after the spell is cast, all concealed enemies within the area of effect will become visible to the caster and his allies. Invisible objects carried into the warded area will also become visible. This spell does not reveal illusions or enable the caster to see through physical objects. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.~

@457=~Horror~
@458=~Horror
Level: 2
School: Necromancy
Range: Long
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 30' radius

@459=~Invisibility~
@460=~Invisibility
Level: 2
School: Illusion
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around him such as opening doors, disarming traps, or opening chests. An invisible creature can drink a potion, or cast non-attack spells centered on himself and remain invisible, but he cannot attack nor cast spells on other targets without ending the spell. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 8 hours have passed.~

@461=~Battering Ram~
@462=~Battering Ram
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Range: Medium
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature or object
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a ram-like force that can strike with considerable power. The force can be used to open or smash locked, held, or wizard-locked doors, as well as locked boxes or chests, but it does not raise barred gates or similar impediments. If used against a creature, the target suffers 2d6 points of crushing damage, and must save vs. breath to avoid being knocked unconscious for 1 round.~

@463=~Know Opponent~
@464=~Know Opponent
Level: 2
School: Divination
Range: Long
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard's eyes glow with magical energy, enabling him to read the aura of a creature, and determine the creature's strengths and weaknesses. For the duration of the spell, the target's physical resistances are lowered by 10% and all attacks against the target creature are made with a +2 bonus to the attack roll. Certain magical devices negate the power of the Know Opponent spell, and the spell has no effect on creatures who don't emanate auras, such as constructs. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.~

@465=~Luck~
@466=~Luck
Level: 2
School: Enchantment
Range: Medium
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell is lucky in everything that he does for the next hour. The affected character receives a 5% or +1 bonus to all of his actions. This includes saving throws, to hit chances, damage rolls, thieving skills, etc. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~

@467=~Resist Fear~
@468=~Resist Fear
Level: 2
School: Abjuration
Range: Long
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: None

The wizard instills courage in allies, raising their morale to its highest. If the recipients are affected by magical fear, this is negated. In addition, the recipients are protected from magical fear for the duration of the spell.~

@469=~Melf's Acid Arrow~
@470=~Melf's Acid Arrow
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Range: Long
Duration: 1 round/3 levels
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical arrow that speeds to its target unerringly. The arrow inflicts 1d6 points of missile damage, and 2d4 points of acid damage. For every three levels that the caster has achieved, the acid lasts for another round, unless somehow dispelled, inflicting another 2d4 points of damage each round. So at 3rd-5th level, the acid lasts for two rounds, at 6th-8th level, the acid lasts for three rounds, and so on (up to a maximum of six rounds at 15th level).~

@471=~Mirror Image~
@472=~Mirror Image
Level: 2
School: Illusion
Range: Personal
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When a Mirror Image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes a number of illusory duplicates of himself to come into being around him. The spell creates two images plus one for every 3 levels of the caster (up to a maximum of eight images at 18th level). These images do exactly what the wizard does, and since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is directly struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, while other existing images remain intact. It is important to note that this will not protect the caster against all attacks, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is under the effects of a Reflected Image spell, and casting the spell multiple times will not multiply the number of images created.~

@473=~Stinking Cloud~
@474=~Stinking Cloud
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Poison negates

When Stinking Cloud is cast, a billowing mass of nauseous vapors appears centered on a point selected by the caster. Any creature caught within the cloud must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or be nauseated for 1 round. Nauseated characters are unable to attack or cast spells, but can still move. Those who make successful saving throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save each round. A dispel magic will temporarily remove the nausea from a particular character, but they will continue to be subjected to the spell's effects so long as they remain within the cloud. Certain creatures are immune to the effects of the cloud, including all undead, and creatures who don't need to breathe, such as elementals.~

@475=~Strength~
@476=~Strength
Level: 2
School: Alteration
Range: Short
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Application of this spell sets the strength of the character to 18 and then adds 50 exceptional strength on top of this. The character receives any strength bonuses appropriate. For example, if a character has between 18/50 and 18/00 strength, then his strength will just be set to 18/00. If a character has a strength between 18/01 and 18/50, then his strength will become 18/50 + original percentage. If his strength is less then 18, then it will just become 18/50. However, this spell will actually lower a character's strength if it is already 19 or more.~

@477=~Web~
@478=~Web
Level: 2
School: Conjuration
Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 20' radius
Saving Throw: Breath negates

A Web spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. The Web spell covers a maximum area of about 20 feet in radius. Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers. Creatures that make a successful saving throw vs. breath can move at half speed through the area, but must make additional saving throws each round they remain in the area of effect. A failed saving throw means the creature is stuck in the webs, unable to move for that round. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are spiders and exceptionally large and strong creatures who suffer little to no distress from the webs.~

@479=~Agannazar's Scorcher~
@480=~Agannazar's Scorcher
Level: 2
School: Evocation
Range: Medium
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, a jet of flame appears at the caster's fingertips and bursts out toward one target of the caster's choice. That target will be hit by this flame for 3d6 points of damage. The fiery ray will persist for one further round, burning the victim for another 3d6 points of fire damage. Other creatures who cross the path of the flame jet will also take damage as long as they stand in the flame. There is no saving throw against this spell, though anti-fire capabilities such as fire resistance will apply and may reduce or eliminate the damage.~

Level: 2
School: Necromancy
Range: Personal
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Death partial

When the caster completes this spell, a red glow encompasses his hand. On a successful touch from the wizard, the spell inflicts 1d8 points of magic damage and paralyzes the target for 5 rounds unless a successful save vs. death at a -1 penalty is made. The wizard gains a +4 bonus to hit the target and his touch is considered to be of +1 enchantment to determine what it can hit.~

The recipient of this spell gains the ability to cast spells with a verbal component without having to make any noise. Effectively, this spell cancels the silenced effect and makes the recipient immune to it for the spell's duration. This spell has no effect on other noises or speech - it simply removes a spell's verbal component.~

When a wizard utters this power word, he causes a comatose slumber to come upon one creature. Creatures who currently have 20 or more hit points can save vs. spell to avoid the effects, but those with 1 to 19 hit points are powerless to resist. Elves and half-elves are particularly resistant to sleep effects, while the undead and certain other creatures such as dragons and elementals are completely immune to magically induced sleep.~

Saving Throw: Spell negates

By means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, a wizard weakens an opponent, reducing its strength and thereby the attacks that rely upon it. The victim suffers a -3 penalty to attack and damage rolls and has its movement speed reduced by 50% unless they make a successful saving throw vs. spell at a -2 penalty.~

Chaos Shield increases a wild mage's chance to gain a favorable result when a wild surge occurs. Every time a roll is made on the wild surge chart, an extra 15 is added to the dice roll. When Nahal's Reckless Dweomer is cast, the bonus from Chaos Shield stacks with the wild mage's level bonus.~

Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 10'
Saving Throw: Breath partial

This spell blasts an area with a tremendous cacophony. Enemies within the area suffer 4d4 points of crushing damage, and are deafened for 1 turn. A successful save vs. breath at -2 penalty halves the damage and negates the deafness. Deafened spellcasters have a 50% chance to miscast any spell. This deafness can be done away with by means of a Dispel Magic spell or a Cure Disease spell.~

This spell creates a cloud of glittering golden particles within the area of effect. The sparkling dust dazzles all opponents in the area (-2 penalty to attack rolls) for 4 rounds and reveals any opponents who are invisible. Those affected must also save vs. breath to avoid becoming completely covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle for 4 rounds. Those failing the save remain unable to successfully hide themselves until the dust fades.~

This spell creates a cloud of glittering golden particles within the area of effect. All enemies in the area must roll a successful saving throw vs. breath at -1 or be blinded (-10 penalty to attack rolls) for 4 rounds. All within the area become covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades. This dust reveals all invisible opponents in the area.~

Level: 3
School: Divination
Range: Personal
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell grants an unnatural perception of things to come. Once Clairvoyance is cast, the caster receives instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm. He becomes impossible to surprise and cannot be backstabbed. In addition, the spell gives a general idea of what action might be taken to best protect oneself, granting a +2 insight bonus to AC and saves vs. breath. The effects last for the duration of the spell, and cannot be dispelled.~

@503=~Dispel Magic~
@504=~Dispel Magic
Level: 3
School: Abjuration
Range: Long
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 20' radius
Saving Throw: Special

Dispel Magic dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is above the level of the magic he is trying to dispel, his chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the level of the magic he attempts to dispel, his chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.~

Level: 3
School: Conjuration

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Breath half

This spell enables the caster to hurl flaming arrows at his enemies. The caster receives one arrow for every two experience levels (up to a maximum of five arrows at level 10), and each arrow inflicts 1d6 points of missile damage plus 1d6 points of fire damage. Upon completion of the spell, the first arrow will streak towards the creature targeted by the wizard, while additional arrows will randomly target opponents within range.~

@508=~Fireball
Level: 3
School: Evocation
Range: Long
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Breath half

A fireball is an explosive burst of flame that detonates with a low roar, delivering damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it - 1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 10d6). The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures who fail their saving throw vs. breath at -2 suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half damage.~

Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 20' radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the affected creatures gain +6 to movement rate and can make an extra half attack each round. Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected. Haste negates and counters the effects of a Slow spell. When the spell ends, affected creatures become winded for 3 rounds. While winded they receive penalties of -2 to hit, damage, and armor class. This spell is not cumulative with itself or with other similar magic.~

@512=~Hold Person
Level: 3
School: Enchantment

Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 5'
Saving Throw: Spell negates

This spell holds one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for one turn. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also affected. Those who succeed at a saving throw vs. spell at -2 are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held with this spell.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

Saving Throw: None

This spell confers invisibility upon all friendly creatures within 10 feet of the caster. Creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not. If an affected creature makes an attack, they will negate the invisibility only for themselves. The spell otherwise lasts for 1 turn.~

Saving Throw: Breath half

Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the spellcaster (maximum damage of 10d6) to the target creature. A successful saving throw vs. breath at -4 reduces this damage to half.~

By means of this spell, the caster summons a number of monsters, which serve the mage under any conditions.

The summoned creatures will remain under the wizard's control until they are slain or the spell duration expires.

Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the wizard makes the creature touched undetectable by divination spells such as Detect Invisibility, Oracle, and True Seeing, or by a thief's Detect Illusion ability, though an invisible person may still be audible when moving and his presence may still be sensed. Non-Detection wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.~

Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the wizard bestows upon a creature total invulnerability to hurled and projected missiles such as arrows, axes, bolts, javelins, and sling stones. This spell does not convey any protection from magical attacks such as Fireballs, Lightning Bolts, or Magic Missiles, but magically created missiles such as Melf's Acid Arrows, Melf's Minute Meteors, and Flame Arrows will be harmlessly deflected.~

@524=~Slow
Level: 3
School: Alteration
Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Polymorph negates

A Slow spell causes creatures to move and attack at half of their normal rates unless a save vs. polymorph at -2 is made. Slowed creatures also suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls, AC, and saves vs. breath. Spellcasting time is doubled, though spell effects are not affected. Furthermore, the rate at which these creatures regenerate or suffer damage from poison is halved. At the instant the spell is completed, all hostile creatures in 30 foot radius of a point selected by the caster will be affected (thus, creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not). It negates the effects of a Haste spell, but does not otherwise affect magically speeded or slowed creatures. This spell is not cumulative with itself or with other similar magic.~

@525=~Skull Trap~
@526=~Skull Trap
Level: 3
School: Necromancy
Range: Medium
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 20' radius
Saving Throw: Breath half

Upon casting this spell, a skull is thrown by the caster at the target area. The skull floats in the area until a creature comes within 15 feet of it. When this happens, the skull is triggered and explodes, damaging everyone within a 20 foot radius. The explosion deals 1d6 points of magic damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d6), with a save vs. breath at -2 allowed for half damage. When casting this spell, it is wise to set it far away from the party, lest they set it off accidentally. Undead creatures are not affected by this spell.~

@527=~Vampiric Touch~
@528=~Vampiric Touch
Level: 3
School: Necromancy
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the target loses 3 hit points for every two caster levels, to a maximum drain of 30 for a 20th level caster. These hit points are added to the caster's current hit points, with any hit points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary additional hit points. The temporary hit points last for 5 turns.

Note that this spell may not be cast multiple times to radically increase the caster's hit points. The caster must wait for the first Vampiric Touch spell to run its course before casting another.~

@529=~Dire Charm~
@530=~Dire Charm
Level: 3
School: Enchantment
Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Spell negates

This spell works in the exact same manner as Charm Person, with two differences: the saving throw has no bonus, and the enchantment has a longer duration. Dire Charm affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. If the recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed creature will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed creature by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creature, the charm spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence.~

@531=~Ghost Armor~
@532=~Ghost Armor
Level: 3
School: Illusion
Range: Touch
Duration: 10 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard creates an insubstantial but quasi-real suit of armor. This semi-illusory material covers the subject and actually gives some real protection provided that opponents don't actively disbelieve in the armor (detecting the illusion) and neither a dispel magic nor detect illusion spell is cast upon it. Until dispelled or disbelieved, the armor sets the recipient's base armor class to 2. This spell will not function with any other form of magical armor, but it is cumulative with dexterity bonuses and, in the case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The ghost armor does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting. A favourite among mage/thieves, the ghostly nimbus of light which surrounds the recipient grants +20% bonus to Hide in Shadows.~

@534=~Minor Spell Deflection
Level: 3
School: Abjuration
Range: Personal
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This abjuration spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 6 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 4th level spell. Spells greater than 4th level will not be affected. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic. However, it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.

This spell absorbs spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but will not protect against area effect spells that are not centered directly upon the wizard (such as Fireball), or stationary area effect spells (such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud).~

When this spell is cast, it will dispel one spell protection of 5th level or lower on all enemies within the area of effect. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on a target first. If a target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

The spell protections dispelled by Spell Thrust are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen and Spell Shield.~

This spell stops undead creatures in their place for the duration of the spell. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Any undead creatures within 5 feet of the target are also affected. Those who succeed at a saving throw vs. spell at -2 are totally unaffected by the spell.

Those affected become unable move or groan, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence the effect does not stop any worsening of their condition due to injury or rot.~

This spell enables the wizard to summon small globes of fire (one for each level of experience of the caster), which, when thrown, burst upon impact and inflict 1d4 points of piercing damage plus 2d4 points of fire damage to the creature struck. The wizard gains a +5 bonus to hit with the missiles, and each meteor is considered to be of +2 enchantment to determine what it can hit. The wizard may discharge up to five missiles per round.~

Area of Effect: 20' radius
Saving Throw: Special

Dispel Magic removes magical effects upon any enemies within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is above the level of the magic he is trying to dispel, his chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the level of the magic he attempts to dispel, his chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.~

This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. All hostile creatures within the area of effect are allowed a saving throw vs. spell at -2. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Those who fail their saving throws will either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about for the duration of the spell. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible, according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.~

This spell transports the caster to any place within sight. When the spell is cast, a dimensional portal opens up in front of the caster, which he immediately steps through. Upon passing through the portal, the caster finds himself at his chosen destination. The caster always arrives at exactly the spot desired, and the dimensional door doesn't allow anyone or anything else to pass through. Spells about to be cast upon the wizard will fail, and missiles about to hit him will instead hit thin air.~

This spell conjures an acid shield around the caster. This shield not only grants the user 50% acid resistance, but also protects the caster from attacks made within a 5' radius. Opponents that hit the caster with a weapon or spell from within this radius will suffer 4d4 points of acid damage. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative, but it can be used in conjunction with similar spells. Tiny and small flying creatures cannot pass through the caustic barrier.

Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the Invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that there are sometimes telltale traces, a shimmering, that enable observant opponents to approximate the invisible character's whereabouts. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for, after the creature has made his presence known. Once the character has revealed himself, opponents can attempt to attack him with conventional weapons, though they do so with a -4 penalty to the attack roll, or they may cast area of effect spells near his position. Opponents remain unable to directly target the invisible creature with spells, scrolls, or abilities until the spell duration expires or the invisibility is dispelled.~

This spell creates a faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Fourth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by a successful dispel magic.~

Range: Personal
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When a wizard casts this powerful spell upon himself, an outer skin of stone will emerge from the ground, completely covering and shielding him. This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the wizard in no way. The effect of this is to protect the wizard from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. One skin is gained for every two levels of the caster. For example, a 10th level wizard would receive 5 skins while a 20th level wizard would receive 10. For each skin the wizard possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against him, but the sixth would affect him normally. The skins will remain on the wizard until he is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires.

It is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any area attacks (such as Fireball), and that any weapon capable of inflicting some type of elemental damage can still harm the caster - the skins will not protect against fire, cold, acid, or electrical damage, even if physical damage is blocked. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~

Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the mage is able to free a victim from enchantments and curses. The spell can reverse the effects of confusion and feeblemindedness, free a victim from petrification, magical sleep or charm, and break the effects of a curse. Note that Break Enchantment cannot remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, but allows those afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or through a particular ritual.~

Range: Long
Duration: 2 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Spell negates

When this spell is cast, the wizard can disturb the emotional state of those around him. The effect of this is to inflict a feeling of absolute hopelessness upon enemies within visual range of the caster. Upon a failed saving throw vs. spell at -2, those affected will receive a -4 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage, and a +4 penalty to armor class. This will last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

@584=~Greater Malison
Level: 4
School: Enchantment
Range: Long
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: None

The spell allows the caster to adversely affect the dice rolls of their enemies. The effect is applied to all hostile creatures within the area of effect. Those under the influence of this spell make all their saving throws at a penalty of -2 and also suffer a -1 penalty to luck. Magic resistance does not affect this spell, and multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~

@586=~Otiluke's Resilient Sphere
Level: 4
School: Alteration
Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Spell negates

When this spell is cast, the result is a globe of shimmering force that encloses the subject creature if it fails to successfully save vs. breath at a -4 penalty. The resilient sphere will contain its subject for the duration of the spell. The sphere is completely immune to all damage. Actually, the only method of removing the sphere is a successful dispel magic. Hence, the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks, but at the same time is completely unable to affect the outside world.

The caster has the option of using the spell to protect her allies. Resistances and saving throws are bypassed when the target is willing.~

@587=~Spirit Armor~
@588=~Spirit Armor
Level: 4
School: Necromancy
Range: Touch
Duration: 10 turns
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell taps the target's life force in order to create a corporeal barrier around his body. The armor itself is weightless, and does not hinder movement or spellcasting in any way. The spirit armor does not work cumulatively with any other armor, but it will stack with bonuses from dexterity, shields, and magical trinkets. While in effect, the armor class of the recipient will be set to 1, and saving throws vs. death will be made with a +3 bonus. There is a danger in using this spell, however, as the external portion of the target's spirit is temporarily lost when the spell duration expires. This causes the recipient to suffer 2d4 points of damage, unless he succeeds at a saving throw vs. spell.~

@589=~Polymorph Other~
@590=~Polymorph Other
Level: 4
School: Alteration
Range: Long
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Polymorph negates

Polymorph Other is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. The target's mental attributes are not affected and they do not receive the special abilities of the new form, but physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form and the affected creature loses any special abilities it had in its original form. This particular version of the spell will transform the recipient into a squirrel unless a save vs. polymorph is made successfully. The effectiveness of this spell is dependent upon the target's level, with weak creatures being relatively easy to transmute and more powerful creatures being very difficult. Creatures with less than 8 HD/levels save at a -3 penalty, those with 8 - 14 HD/levels save normally, and those with 15 or more HD/levels save with a +3 bonus. The transformation is instant and permanent until a dispel magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature.

Note that all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form. However, they will return to their previous state once the target dies or the effects are dispelled.~

Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form of another creature: that of a flind, an ogre, a mustard jelly, a sword spider, or a winter wolf. The caster also gains the form's physical mode of locomotion and breathing. This spell does not give the caster access to the new form's other abilities such as special attacks or magic, nor does it run the risk of the wizard changing personality and mentality.

For the duration of the spell, the caster may transform into any of the new forms at any time, as many times as he wishes. The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases and may use weapons in others. The wizard's mental attributes are not affected, but physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. Also, any natural protections that the new form offers are conferred to the wizard.

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

By means of this spell, the wizard creates the illusion of a door. The illusion also permits the wizard to appear to step through this "door" and disappear. In reality he has darted aside and can flee, totally invisible, for the spell duration. Opponents within 5 feet of the caster must save vs. spell or be fooled into following the caster through the door, becoming trapped in an extradimensional room for up to 4 rounds. Creatures with exceptional intelligence may escape the illusion faster, while creatures who can see through illusions (e.g. dragons, liches, demons), or are under the effects of a True Seeing spell, are unaffected.~

The Domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of any one creature while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim.

Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also affected. Those who succeed at a saving throw vs. spell at -2 are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held with this spell.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

@638=~Lower Resistance
Level: 5
School: Alteration
Range: Long
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When cast upon a target creature, this spell will lower their magic resistance by 2% per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 40% at 20th level). There is no saving throw vs. this spell and magic resistance is ignored. This spell is not affected by dispel magic. Once it has been cast, there is no way to cancel the effects until the spell expires.

For example, if a creature has 50% magic resistance and this spell is cast on it by a 15th level mage, then its magic resistance would be lowered by 30% automatically. This effect is cumulative for each casting of this spell. If this spell was cast upon this same creature again, the creature's magic resistance would be 50% - 30% (initial casting) - 30% (current casting) which would leave the creature with 0% magic resistance after both spells have been cast.~

Upon casting Conjure Lesser Fire Elemental, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, and a fire elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcaster. The elemental has 8 Hit Dice and will serve the caster's every whim until banished back to its home plane, the spell duration expires, or upon the elemental's death. It is particularly difficult to maintain a gate to the Inner Planes - there is a 15% chance that the portal opened by the caster will collapse before the elemental enters the Prime Material Plane.

@646=~Phantom Blade
Level: 5
School: Illusion
Range: Personal
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a translucent, weightless, shadowlike sword made of material from the Plane of Shadow that extends 3 feet from the caster's hand. The caster wields the phantom blade as if it was a long sword but he suffers no penalty for non-proficiency. The sword deals 1d12+4 points of magic damage to its victims, and an additional 10 points of damage against undead creatures. Due to its ethereal nature, strength bonuses do not apply, but attacks with the phantom blade are considered melee touch attacks, and thus gain a +4 bonus to hit. Furthermore, a successful strike temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail (save vs. spell at a -4 penalty negates). The blade is considered to be of +4 enchantment when determining what it can hit, but it cannot harm inorganic things because it has no solid existence. The phantom blade can only be used by the caster, and remains in his hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting Conjure Lesser Earth Elemental, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Earth, and an earth elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcaster. The elemental has 8 Hit Dice and will serve the caster's every whim until banished back to its home plane, the spell duration expires, or upon the elemental's death. It is particularly difficult to maintain a gate to the Inner Planes - there is a 15% chance that the portal opened by the caster will collapse before the elemental enters the Prime Material Plane.

@654=~Spell Deflection
Level: 5
School: Abjuration
Range: Personal
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This abjuration spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 9 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 7th level spell. Spells greater than 7th level will not be affected. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic. However, it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.

This spell absorbs spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but will not protect against area effect spells that are not centered directly upon the wizard (such as Fireball), or stationary area effect spells (such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud).~

Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15' radius
Saving Throw: Breath half

This spell creates an explosive burst of flame that detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it, similar to a fireball. The wizard gestures with his hand and the entire area around him erupts in flames, striking all except the caster for 1d6 points of damage per level of the wizard (up to a maximum of 15d6). Creatures who fail their saving throw vs. breath at -4 suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half damage.~

Level: 6
School: Conjuration
Range: Long
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons an invisible stalker from the Elemental Plane of Air. This 8 hit dice monster obeys and serves the spellcaster in performing whatever tasks are set before it, even if this means being sent to certain death. The creature remains under the caster's control for 8 hours or until it is killed - at which point it will return to its native plane, only slightly annoyed at having to serve a mortal.

Invisible Stalker (8 Hit Dice):
STR 18, DEX 19, CON 14, INT 11, WIS 14, CHA 11;  AL Neutral
HP 64, AC -2, THAC0 7, Saving Throws 10/12/11/12/13

@664=~Globe of Invulnerability
Level: 6
School: Abjuration
Range: Personal
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd- or 4th-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Fifth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by a successful dispel magic spell, as well as other forms of magical attack such as Pierce Magic and Spellstrike.~

@666=~Tenser's Transformation
Level: 6
School: Alteration
Range: Personal
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Tenser's Transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power. For when the mage casts the spell, he undergoes a startling transformation which alters his body and his mind into that of a warrior. The wizard gains 2 hit points per caster level (up to a maximum of 40), and all damage he sustains comes first from the magical points gained. The armor class of the caster is 4 better than he possessed prior casting the spell, and all attack rolls are made with the THAC0 of a fighter of the same level as the caster. The mage gains extra attacks as a fighter of the same level, thus an extra half attack per round at 7th level and another half attack per round at 13th level. Furthermore, each attack is made at +2, each successful hit in combat inflicts an additional 2 points of damage, and saving throws against death/poison are made by the caster with a +4 bonus, but casting speed is penalized by 2 and saving throws against spell are made by the caster with a -2 penalty.

Note: this spell does not give any extra attacks to multiclassed or dual-classed fighter/mages, as they normally gain additional attacks per round due to their fighter levels.~

Level: 6

Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

Flesh to Stone is a powerful magic that permanently turns the flesh of the creature affected into stone. When struck by this spell the target is slowed for 3 rounds as its flesh begins to harden. The following round the subject of the spell must save vs. petrification at -4 or be turned into a statue. A dispel magic spell cannot restore the victim's natural form, but some powerful spells, such as Stone to Flesh or Freedom, can. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or incorporeal creatures.~

@672=~Protection from Magic Energy
Level: 6

Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When a Protection from Magic Energy spell is cast, the recipient receives complete protection from all magic damage-based attacks. 100% of the damage from attacks like Cause Wound will be absorbed, and the target creature will become completely immune to the effects of spells such as Magic Missile, Skull Trap, Disintegrate, and Horrid Wilting. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

@674=~Mislead
Level: 6
School: Illusion
Range: Personal
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast the wizard is affected with an Improved Invisibility spell and is teleported a few feet away from his original position. Meanwhile an exact image of the caster is created where he used to be with exactly the same hit points as the caster. The illusory double vanishes after 6 rounds and cannot perform any actions at all, like attacking or casting spells. It can, however, move around and act as a decoy for the invisible mage. As long as the image isn't destroyed, the caster can attack and cast spells while remaining completely hidden. The image will remain under the control of the caster until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until it is affected by a dispel magic or a spell that destroys the illusion.~

@675=~Pierce Magic~
@676=~Pierce Magic
Level: 6
School: Abjuration
Range: Long
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast upon a target creature there will be two major effects. The first is that it will dispel one spell protection of 8th level or lower from the creature. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. The second effect of the spell is that the creature's magic resistance is temporary nullified. The resistance remains lowered for 2 rounds, and this effect cannot be negated in any way. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.

The spell protection spells dispelled by Pierce Magic are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen, Spell Shield, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection and Shield of the Archons.~

@677=~True Seeing~
@678=~True Seeing
Level: 6
School: Divination
Range: Personal
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster gains the ability to see the exact locations of creatures or objects under displacement or invisibility effects, and see through illusions. This effectively neutralize spells such as Blur and Mirror Image, allow the caster to see and target invisible creatures normally, and make him unaffected by hostile illusion spells such as Spook. The caster is also cured from any form of blindness and is immune to it for the duration of the spell.

Note: True Seeing does not dispel illusionary clones such as those conjured by Mislead or Simulacrum, but instead clearly highlights them, revealing them as deceptions.~

@679=~Protection from Magical Weapons~
@680=~Protection from Magical Weapons
Level: 6
School: Abjuration
Range: Personal
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that cannot be penetrated by magical weapons; all such weapons are harmlessly deflected (missile weapons strike the sphere, then immediately fall to the ground). This includes weapons that are blessed or enchanted as well as attacks of especially powerful monsters. Due to this spell's short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of combat. The spell's effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

@681=~Power Word Silence~
@682=~Power Word Silence
Level: 6
School: Enchantment
Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When a Power Word Silence spell is uttered, the target creature becomes unable make any sound for 1 turn. This silence completely foils any spellcasting because it prevents the target from uttering the required verbal components. The only counters to this spell are a dispel magic or Vocalize.~

@684=~Improved Haste
Level: 6

Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, each affected creature functions at double normal movement rate, gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls, armor class, and saving throws vs. breath, and can make one extra attack each round. Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected. There are two major differences between the third level wizard spell Haste and this spell. The first major difference is that there is no period of fatigue following the expiration of this spell. The other major difference is that Improved Haste cannot be countered by Slow.~

@685=~Acid Fog~
@686=~Acid Fog
Level: 6
School: Conjuration
Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a thick, clinging, greenish cloud. All creatures who aren't immune to acid suffer 10 points of damage for each round they are exposed to the vapors of the Acid Fog. In addition, due to reduced visibility, creatures inside the cloud move at 50% of their normal rate.~

@687=~Chain Lightning~
@688=~Chain Lightning
Level: 6
School: Evocation
Range: Long
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 30'
Saving Throw: Breath half

This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from the caster's fingertips. Unlike Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets. These brilliant arcs of lightning leap at all enemies within range, burning them with electrical damage. The lightning causes 1d6 points of damage for every level of the caster to the primary target (up to a maximum of 20d6) and 1d6 for every two levels to subsequent targets (up to a maximum of 10d6). Those who roll successful saving throws vs. breath at -4 manage to partially avoid direct impact from the lightning and hence receive only half damage.~

@690=~Disintegrate
Level: 6
School: Alteration
Range: Long
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Breath partial

Upon casting this spell at another creature, a thin green ray shoots unerringly from the caster's fingertip toward the target. Upon contact, the creature must make a saving throw vs. breath at -2 or suffer 2d6 points of magic damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). A creature that makes a successful save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as a Mordenkainen's Sword, which is automatically destroyed when struck. This spell has no affect on clothing or equipment carried by the target.~

@691=~Contingency~
@692=~Contingency
Level: 6
School: Universal
Range: Personal
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell out of his repertoire of known spells. The spell level must be lower or equal to the level of the caster divided by three. Once the spell is chosen, the caster is allowed to choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of his maximum hit points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically. For example, a 12th level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a contingency with the starting condition being 'the wizard reaches 50% of his maximum hit points'. Then once the wizard is reduced to 50% or less of his total hit points in combat, Stoneskin would be immediately cast upon him. This requires no action by the wizard, happening automatically and instantaneously. The limitation of this spell is that the target of the spell placed in the contingency must be the caster. Therefore, the spell stored cannot be an offensive spell nor can it target any other party members.~

@694=~Spell Deflection
Level: 6
School: Abjuration
Range: Personal

Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This abjuration spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 9 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 7th level spell. Spells greater than 7th level will not be affected. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic. However, it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.

This spell absorbs spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but will not protect against area effect spells that are not centered directly upon the wizard (such as Fireball), or stationary area effect spells (such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud).~

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting a Conjure Fire Elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, and a fire elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcaster. Normally, an elemental with 12 hit dice will be conjured. At fifteenth level and above, however, the caster will be able to summon an elemental with 16 hit dice. The elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain or the duration of the spell runs out. All of the commands given to the elemental are done so telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication, and it is not necessary to know the language of the summoned creature. It is particularly difficult to maintain a gate to the Inner Planes - there is a 15% chance that the portal opened by the caster will collapse before the elemental enters the Prime Material Plane.

Saving Throw: None

By casting the Summon Nishruu spell, the wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power, the Nishruu. At first glance, this appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination the churning red mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn towards magic like a moth to the flame, the Nishruu feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better. Nishruus do not use physical attacks, and they disregard physical attacks made on them, though these attacks can hurt them. Each time a Nishruu touches and wraps its tendrils around a target, it will drain magical energies from him. Excluding Banishment or a dispel magic, the Nishruu is completely immune to magic, and not only that, but magic will actually heal this creature. The creature will remain under the wizard's control until reduced to 0 hit points, dispelled, or the spell duration expires.

The image can move around, and has the same hit points and can cast the same spells as the wizard, but it cannot make any physical attacks. The caster must maintain concentration on the illusory clone for the duration of the spell and cannot perform any other action while controlling it.

By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack his foes and himself if not careful. The creature summoned in is a Death Knight, a powerful undead demon. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for him for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster. Mages are warned to be careful of this spell, for a mistreated Death Knight will turn on his summoner at the first available opportunity.

Duration: 8 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By casting the Summon Hakeashar spell, the wizard calls into existance a magical being of considerable power, the Hakeashar. The Hakeashar is a more powerful version of the Nishruu, having more hit points, better attacks, and immunity to normal weapons. At first glance, this appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination the churning grey mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn towards magic like a moth to the flame, the Hakeashar feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better. Hakeashars do not use physical attacks, and they disregard physical attacks made on them, though these attacks can hurt them. Each time a Hakeashar touches and wraps its tendrils around a target, it will drain magical energies from him. Excluding Banishment or a dispel magic, the Hakeashar is completely immune to magic, and not only that, but magic will actually heal this creature. The creature will remain under the wizard's control until reduced to 0 hit points, dispelled, or the spell duration expires.

The Control Undead spell allows the caster to take control of undead creatures within the area of effect. This creates a telepathic link between the caster and the undead, allowing complete control. If the undead have 5 or more Hit Dice/levels less than the caster then there is no saving throw allowed, else a save vs. spell at -6 is allowed to negate the effect. The undead remain under control of the caster for the duration of the spell or until they are affected by a dispel magic.~

Level: 7

Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Limited Wish is a very potent but difficult spell. It will fulfill literally, but only partially or for a limited duration, the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. The use of a Limited Wish will not substantially change major realities. The spell can, for example, restore some hit points lost by the wizard. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher. Lastly, the wiser the wizard, the better chance that he will choose the right wording. Wizards with low wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.~

Level: 8
School: Alteration
Range: Personal
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard and all of his gear assume a visible, incorporeal form like that of a manifesting ghost. The caster is subject only to magical or special attacks, including those by weapons of +1 enchantment or better, or by creatures otherwise able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. Even when hit by magical attacks, any physical damage sustained while in ghost form is reduced by 50%. Non-damaging spell effects affect the caster normally unless they require corporeal targets to function (e.g. Polymorph Other, Flesh to Stone, Disintegrate, and Implosion) or create a corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would normally be unaffected by (e.g. Entangle, Grease, and Web).

As an incorporeal creature, the caster moves silently and cannot be heard (+100% Move Silently) or backstabbed. While in ghost form, the caster has a base armor class of 0 and is immune to the effects of disease and poison. Any melee attack made while in ghost form is considered a melee touch attack and thus gains a +4 bonus to the attack roll, while projectiles become corporeal as soon as they are fired. The transformation lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration runs out, but cannot be used in conjunction with other shapeshifting spells such as Polymorph Self and Shapechange.~

The creature summoned in is a Glabrezu, one of the most powerful specimen of the Tanar'ri. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for him for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster.

@816=~Gate
Level: 9
School: Conjuration
Range: Medium
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack his foes and himself if not careful. The creature summoned in is a Pit Fiend, the most powerful specimen of the Baatezu. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for him for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster. Mages are warned to be careful of this spell, for a mistreated Pit Fiend will turn on his summoner at the first available opportunity, tear him and his companions apart piece by piece and then feast on the remains.

Pit Fiend (20 Hit Dice):
STR 24, DEX 16, CON 19, INT 20, WIS 16, CHA 25;  AL Lawful Evil
HP 170, AC -8, THAC0 -7, Saving Throws 4/6/4/8/6
5 Attacks Per Round, 2d6+16 Piercing Damage (Claws, Bite, & Tail +4)

Combat Abilities (20% chance each):
Disease: creatures struck by a pit fiend's bite attack must save vs. death at -4 or be infected with a vile disease known as devil chills, losing 2 points of strength after an incubation period of 12 hours
Poison: a pit fiend's bite injects a lethal poison which inflicts 10 points of damage every second for 2 rounds unless a save vs. poison at -4 penalty is made
Constrict: creatures struck by the pit fiend's tail must save vs. death at -4 to avoid being stunned for 1 round

Special Qualities:
Immune to weapons lower than +3 enchantment
Immune to confusion, fear, poison, & stun effects
Regeneration: 2hp/round

@818=~Absolute Immunity
Level: 9
School: Abjuration
Range: Personal
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When Absolute Immunity is cast, the caster gains complete invulnerability to physical and magical damage. This spell is incredibly powerful, hence the short duration. Combined with a short casting time, these factors make the spell ideally suited for use in the thick of combat where buying a few seconds can mean the difference between life or death.~

@819=~Chain Contingency~
@820=~Chain Contingency
Level: 9
School: Universal
Range: Personal
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Chain Contingency channels some of the magical energy of the mage and releases it only under certain circumstances. Basically, the mage chooses three spells, which will be released under certain conditions such as being hit by an enemy. When this condition occurs all three spells are cast immediately. Spells of up to 8th level may be used in the contingency.~

@821=~Time Stop~
@822=~Time Stop
Level: 9
School: Alteration
Range: Personal
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting a Time Stop spell, the wizard causes the flow of time to stop in the entire area that the caster is currently in. Outside this area the sphere simply seems to shimmer for an instant. Inside the sphere, the caster is free to act for three rounds of apparent time. The wizard can move and act freely within the area where time is stopped, but all other creatures are frozen in their actions, for they are literally between ticks of the time clock. Nothing can enter the area of effect without being stopped in time also. When the spell duration ceases, everyone is again operating in normal time. All spells cast during the Time Stop will take effect immediately after time returns to normal.~

@823=~Imprisonment~
@824=~Imprisonment
Level: 9
School: Abjuration
Range: Short
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the Imprisonment spell is cast the target creature becomes entombed in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth in a state of suspended animation, conscious of its fate. The victim remains there unless the reverse of the spell, Freedom, is cast. Otherwise, the victim will remain imprisoned for 1 turn at the end of which it will die a horrible, despairing death by asphyxiation. If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned then he will reappear exactly where he was last standing. Dispel magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

@826=~Meteor Swarm
Level: 9
School: Evocation
Range: Long
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Breath half

Upon completion of this spell, a swarm of minute meteors bombards the affected area, dealing devastating damage to friend and foe. Any creature caught in the destructive path of the meteors will suffer 40d4 points of fire damage, with a save vs. breath at -4 allowed for half damage. The caster is well advised to be careful in his use of this spell. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.~

@828=~Power Word Kill
Level: 9
School: Enchantment
Range: Long
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

When a Power Word Kill spell is uttered, one creature targeted by the caster is slain. Creatures who currently have 60 or more hit points can save vs. spell to avoid the effects, but those with 1 to 59 hit points are powerless to resist. Even if the creature's maximum hit points are higher than 60, its current hit points are used for this determination.~

@830=~Wail of the Banshee
Level: 9
School: Necromancy
Range: Personal
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Death negates

At the culmination of this dreadful spell, the wizard screams like a banshee (groaning spirit). Everyone in the area of effect hears the awful cry. Enemies who fail a saving throw vs. death at -2 die instantly, and those surviving the wail are deafened for 2 rounds. The caster and his companions are immune to the effects of the wail.~

@832=~Larloch's Energy Drain
Level: 9
School: Necromancy
Range: Short
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a living creature and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane, draining him of 4 levels of experience. The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell. As the life force passes through the caster, it temporarily invigorates him, granting him an additional 20 hit points, a +4 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, and +20% bonus to every skill. These effects last for 1 hour. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to create a black, blade-shaped planar rift, about 5 feet long. It jumps into the caster's hand and is used as a normal sword, remaining there for the duration of the spell. The caster wields the blade as if proficient with the weapon, and brandishes it with a base THAC0 of 0. The sword deals 2d12 damage per strike, and acts as a +5 magical weapon in all regards, including hit and damage bonuses. With each hit, there is a 15% chance the victim must make a save vs. spell at -2 or be disintegrated (40d6 points of magic damage, 5d6 on a successful save).~

Saving Throw: None

With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the form of a powerful creature: that of an iron golem, a mind flayer, a greater wolfwere, or a spirit troll. The spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, and gains almost all of its natural abilities. The caster's mental attributes are not affected, but physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. All clothes and equipment he was wearing will mold into the new form and continue to function, unseen. When the wizard returns to his natural form, they will also return to their previous state. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred.

Area of Effect: Special

When this spell is cast, all friendly creatures in the area are freed from spells and effects that restrict their movement or bind their minds. These effects include charm, confusion, domination, entangle, feeblemindedness, hold, paralysis, petrification, sleep, slow, stun, and web. This spell will also cancel the effects of the spell Maze and return any characters trapped in the labyrinth of planes. If it is cast in an area where a creature was sealed with an Imprisonment spell, it will instantly free him and he will reappear exactly where he was standing when he was imprisoned.~

@841=~Wish~
@842=~Wish
Level: 9
School: Universal

Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Wish is a more potent version of the Limited Wish spell. It will fulfill literally the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher. The wiser the wizard, the better chance that the right wording will be chosen. Wizards with low wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.~
