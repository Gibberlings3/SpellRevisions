By means of this spell, the caster causes plants to entangle all creatures in the area of effect. The grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about the creatures, holding them fast for the duration of the spell. Those held receive a -2 penalty to attack rolls and a +2 penalty to AC. Creatures that make a successful saving throw vs. breath temporarily avoid entanglement and can move at half speed through the area, but must make additional saving throws each round they remain in the area of effect. An entangled creature can attack, provided it does not have to move to reach an opponent.

When the priest casts a Sanctuary spell, it causes all of his opponents to ignore his existence, as if he were invisible. While protected by this spell, the subject cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use non-attack spells focused on himself or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action.

The caster wields the shillelagh as if proficient with the weapon, at his normal THAC0. At level 1, it functions as a magical weapon with an enchantment bonus of +1. For every other four experience levels of the spellcaster, this bonus increases by one, up to a total of +3 enchantment level, +3 to attack rolls, and +3 to damage for a 9th-level caster.

Calling upon the strength of the earth, the caster gains some of the solidity and strength of stone. This spell sets the strength of the character to 18 and then adds 50 exceptional strength on top of this. The character receives any strength bonuses appropriate. For example, if a character has between 18/50 and 18/00 strength, then his strength will just be set to 18/00. If a character has a strength between 18/01 and 18/50, then his strength will become 18/50 + original percentage. If his strength is less then 18, then it will just become 18/50. However, this spell will actually lower a character's strength if it is already 19 or more. For the duration of the spell, the caster also becomes immune to everything, magical or otherwise, that pushes him away (e.g. wing buffets, gusts of wind, telekinesis, etc.), but will move at a reduced speed.~

This spell affects any single person or animal that it is cast upon. The term "person" includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, kobolds, and others. If the target fails their save vs. spell, they regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected for the duration of the spell. The caster may give them orders, and the charmed creature will carry them out as quickly as possible.

Creatures that are currently neutral to the caster are more amenable to helping them and make their saving throw with no bonus, while those that are hostile are significantly more difficult to influence and instead gain a +4 bonus to making their saving throw. If the caster attempts to harm the charmed creature, the spell is broken and the affected creature will immediately become hostile to the caster. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. After the duration of the spell or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the affected creature resumes their previous behavior prior to being charmed.~

When a priest casts a find traps spell, all traps - concealed normally or magically - of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to him. Once per round, all traps within a 30 foot radius of the caster will be revealed. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the creator specifically intended the harmful or undesirable result as such.

Dispel Magic removes magical effects upon any enemies within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is above the level of the magic he is trying to dispel, his chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the level of the magic he attempts to dispel, his chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.~

When a druid casts this powerful spell upon herself, an outer skin of stone will emerge from the ground, completely covering and shielding her. This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the druid in no way. The effect of this is to protect the druid from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. One skin is gained for every two levels of the caster. For each skin the druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th level druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against her but the sixth would affect her normally. The skins will remain on the druid until she is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires.

It is important to note that this will not protect the druid from any area attacks (such as Fireball), and that any weapon capable of inflicting some type of elemental damage can still harm the caster - the skins will not protect against fire, cold, acid, or electrical damage, even if physical damage is blocked.

Polymorph Other is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. The target's mental attributes are not affected and they do not receive the special abilities of the new form, but physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form and the affected creature loses any special abilities it had in its original form. This particular version of the spell will transform the recipient into a squirrel unless a save vs. polymorph is made successfully. The effectiveness of this spell is dependent upon the target's level, with weak creatures being relatively easy to transmute and more powerful creatures being very difficult. Creatures with less than 8 HD/levels save at a -4 penalty, those with 8 - 14 HD/levels save normally, and those with 15 or more HD/levels save with a +2 bonus. The transformation is instant and permanent until a dispel magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature.

Note that all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form. However, they will return to their previous state once the target dies or the effects are dispelled.~

When the caster utters the spell Creeping Doom, he calls forth a horde of venomous biting and stinging arachnids, insects, and myriapods. This carpet-like mass swarms over a large area, spreading to all creatures within 30 feet of the target.

For the duration of the spell, those affected fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round the victims suffer 2d3 points of damage from insect bites, have a 100% chance of spell failure, and must make saving throws vs. death at -2 or be poisoned and panic. If a successful save vs. breath at -4 is made, the target manages to avoid most of the swarm, reducing damage from bites by half and completely negating the spell failure penalty. Poisoned creatures suffer additional 2 points of damage each round for 3 rounds or until cured. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.~

When this spell is cast by a druid, a local earthquake rips the ground. Once every round for the spell's duration, a tremor will take place, affecting all creatures in its area of effect. Earth elementals and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell.

There are three tremors that are caused by the earthquake. The first tremor causes all creatures affected to suffer 6d6 points of damage (save vs. paralyzation at -6 for half damage). Those who fail their saving throw fall to the ground unconscious for 2 rounds. The second tremor is less severe, causing 4d6 points of damage (save vs. death at -4 for half), but is accompanied by fissures opening in the earth, which all affected creatures have a 20% chance to fall into and die (save vs. breath at -4 negates). The final tremor causes 2d6 damage (save vs. death at -2 for half) and there is a 10% chance affected creatures will be trapped within the fissures, causing death (save vs. breath at -2 negates). Creatures knocked unconscious by the first tremor automatically fail any saves to try to avoid falling into or becoming trapped in the fissures.

This spell will affect both enemies and friends of the caster, so care must be taken in its use. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.~

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. Any creature will suffer 1d4 points of piercing damage each round that they remain within the affected area. The spikes can damage the victim's legs, so that even once they are free of the spike growth their movement rate is halved for 3 rounds unless a successful save vs. breath is made. Those failing the save also suffer 1 point of bleeding damage each round for 3 rounds. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are elementals and exceptionally large creatures who suffer little to no distress from the small spikes.~
